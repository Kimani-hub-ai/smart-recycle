# ♻️ SmartRecycle – AI-Powered Waste Classifier

SmartRecycle is a lightweight, AI-driven image classification system that detects whether waste materials are **recyclable** or **non-recyclable** using computer vision and deep learning. Built with TensorFlow and Python, it aims to simplify waste sorting and contribute to a more sustainable planet.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Every day, recyclable waste ends up in landfills because of poor sorting habits and lack of awareness. Manual sorting is inefficient, error-prone, and unsustainable. This results in missed recycling opportunities and increased environmental harm.

---

## 💡 Solution

SmartRecycle leverages a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model to:

- Identify recyclable and non-recyclable items from images
- Provide immediate classification results
- Support integration into smart bins, mobile apps, or educational tools

---

## 🚀 Features

- Image classification using deep learning (CNN)
- Custom-trained on a labeled dataset of waste images
- Real-time prediction capability
- Easy-to-use Python script
- Expandable for IoT and mobile integration

---

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- 🐍 Python 3.x
- 🧠 TensorFlow / Keras
- 📊 NumPy, Pandas
- 🖼️ Matplotlib (for visualization)
- 🗂️ Scikit-learn (confusion matrix, evaluation)
- 🧹 ImageDataGenerator (for augmentation)
